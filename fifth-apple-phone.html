            <p>The iPhone 5 is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the 6th generation iPhone, succeeding both the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S, and preceding both the iPhone 5S and 5C. It was formally unveiled as part of a press event on September 12, 2012, and subsequently released on September 21, 2012.[13] The iPhone 5 was the first iPhone to be announced in September, and setting a trend for subsequent iPhone releases, the first iPhone to be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last iPhone to be overseen by Steve Jobs.[citation needed] The iPhone 5's design was used three times, first with the iPhone 5 itself in 2012, then with the 5S in 2013, and finally with the first-generation iPhone SE in 2016.</p>
