            <p>The iPhone 5, released by Apple in September 2012, marked a significant milestone in the evolution of smartphones. Boasting a sleek and lightweight design, the device featured a 4-inch Retina display, providing users with a vibrant and sharp viewing experience. The introduction of the Lightning connector replaced the traditional 30-pin dock connector, enabling faster data transfer and charging capabilities. The iPhone 5 also embraced a more powerful A6 chip, enhancing overall performance and enabling smoother multitasking.

                One of the notable improvements with the iPhone 5 was its upgraded camera system. The 8-megapixel iSight camera delivered impressive image quality, and the device introduced the Panorama mode, allowing users to capture sweeping landscapes with ease. The front-facing FaceTime HD camera received an upgrade as well, enhancing video calls and selfies.
                
                In terms of connectivity, the iPhone 5 was one of the first devices to support 4G LTE networks, delivering faster internet speeds for seamless browsing and media streaming. The device maintained Apple's commitment to providing a seamless and intuitive user experience, running on iOS 6, which introduced features such as Apple Maps and Passbook.</p>
