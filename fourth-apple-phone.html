            <p>The iPhone 4, released by Apple in June 2010, marked a significant milestone in the evolution of smartphones. Renowned for its sleek design and innovative features, the iPhone 4 represented a departure from its predecessors with its glass and stainless-steel construction, introducing a more sophisticated aesthetic. The device featured a 3.5-inch Retina display, a term coined by Apple to emphasize its high pixel density and exceptional clarity. This advancement in screen technology set a new standard for mobile displays, offering users a vibrant and detailed visual experience.

                One of the standout features of the iPhone 4 was its introduction of FaceTime, Apple's proprietary video calling service. This groundbreaking addition allowed users to engage in face-to-face conversations with friends and family, revolutionizing the way people communicated on their mobile devices. The device also boasted a 5-megapixel rear camera capable of capturing high-quality photos and 720p HD video. The iPhone 4's camera capabilities contributed to the growing trend of mobile photography, inspiring users to capture and share moments with newfound ease.
                
                However, the iPhone 4 was not without its controversies. The device faced scrutiny over its antenna design, which led to signal attenuation issues when users held the phone a certain wayâ€”a phenomenon dubbed "Antennagate." Apple responded by offering free bumper cases to mitigate the problem, demonstrating the company's commitment to customer satisfaction.</p>
